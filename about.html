          <h2><a name="adopt"></a>How does the adoption process work?</h2>
          <p>
            When you&rsquo;ve <a href="adopt.html">found a cat</a> you like, stop by during weekend adoption hours (Saturday and Sunday from 1pm–4pm) at <a href="contact.html">the pet stores</a>, or <a href="contact.html">make an appointment</a> with an adoption counselor. You can also complete an <a href="files/purrs_adoption_application.pdf">adoption application</a> in advance to put a hold on the cat.
          </p>
          <p>Adopters must be at least 21 years old. All members of the household must agree to the adoption.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the store, we'll conduct a brief interview while you socialize with the cat. Once your application is approved (usually same day), you&rsquo;ll complete the <a href="files/purrs_adoption_contract.pdf">adoption contract</a> and make payment (cash, check, or credit card accepted).
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, you&rsquo;ll be ready to take home your new buddy&mdash;along with complete medical records, pet store coupons, and a free veterinary visit.
          </p>

          <h2><a name="declaw"></a>Can I declaw one of your cats?</h2>
          <p>
            We don&rsquo;t support the declawing of cats. When you adopt from PURRS, we&rsquo;ll ask you to agree to never declaw your cat. Declawing can be <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/cats/tips/declawing.html">troubling for the cat</a> and may lead to other behavior problems. Instead, we can help you train your cat to use scratching posts.
          </p>

          <p>
            It&rsquo;s possible, however, to adopt a declawed cat from PURRS. Some cats come to us having already been declawed by previous owners. When this is the case, it will be listed in the cat's profile.
          </p>

          <h2><a name="behavior"></a>My cat’s behavior has become a problem, can you suggest some solutions?</h2>
          <p>
            Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly via phone or email, describing your situation. Tell us about the problem and how long it&rsquo;s been happening. Be sure to include info about any other pets and family members in the household.  We&rsquo;re happy to help&mdash;PURRS offers free behavioral advice for the life of your pet!

          <h2><a name="stray"></a>Where can I find a low cost spay/neuter clinic?</h2>
          <p>
            A great local resource is the <a href="http://fvawl.org/index.php/sn-clinic/services">Fox Valley Animal Welfare League</a> in Aurora. Spaying/neutering is based on income, and prices range from only $30-50 per cat.
          </p>

          <h2><a name="surrender"></a>What should I do if I can no longer keep my pet?</h2>
          <p>
            PURRS doesn&rsquo;t usually accept cats directly from individuals. We bring in our adoptable cats from other organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you originally adopted your cat from a shelter, you <em>must</em> contact that shelter first. They might be able to accept the cat back into their organization, and have the &ldquo;right of first refusal.&rdquo; If the original shelter is unavailable or cannot accept the cat, then...
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>We strongly recommend that you try to find a new home for the cat yourself</strong> since shelters are usually full. Try advertising on sites like Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Ask family, friends, neighbors—and ask them to ask their family, friends and neighbors.  Take great pictures of your cat looking her best and post them just about anywhere you can.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If that doesn't work, you can try contacting a local no-kill shelter</strong> such as the <a href="http://www.napervilleareahumanesociety.org/adoptions/surrender-a-pet">Naperville Area Humane Society</a>.  If they have space available, a small fee usually accompanies their service to help them care for the animal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If you can&rsquo;t find a no-kill shelter, the final option is an animal control facility.</strong> (such as <a href="http://www.dupageco.org/animalcontrol/">DuPage Animal Care &amp; Control</a>, or <a href="http://www.naperville.il.us/animalcontrol.aspx">Naperville Animal Control</a>). Before showing up with your cat, call first to better understand the process.  Ask how full they are—both &rdquo;in back&rdquo; and in their front adoption room. You're looking for a place that has maybe 40 cages in back with more than 12-15 that are empty. You can help your cat get adopted by writing up a good, detailed description. Describe their personality, and anything that stresses them out (young kids, dogs, too many cats in the home, etc.) so a good, appropriate home might be found. The staff really do try to find homes for their animals, but remember space is limited.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2><a name="feral"></a>I have feral cats in my neighborhood, what should I do?</h2>
        <p>
          There is a great program that helps to control the feral cat population in DuPage County called Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR). This service is performed by <a href="http://www.feralfixers.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=5">Feral Fixers</a>. We fully support the efforts of Feral Fixers, which is a donation-driven organization that will spay/neuter feral cats at little or no cost.  If you or someone you know has a feral cat problem, please contact Feral Fixers at (630) 881-FXRS (3977).

        <h2><a name="stray"></a>I found a stray cat...now what?</h2>
        <p>
          PURRS and many other rescues do not take in strays off the street. This is because there is a required 7-day waiting period for strays in DuPage County, to give them a chance to be reclaimed by their owner. You have 3 choices with a stray animal:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Take the cat to any vet, shelter, or PURRS adoption event</strong> (weekends at the pet stores from 1-4pm) and have the cat scanned for a microchip to see if an owner can be located.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notify DuPage Animal Care &amp; Control, plus the Animal Control office of your city AND surrounding cities and file a “Found Pet Report.”</strong> That is where owners are going to check for their lost cat (of course signs around the neighborhood are good too, but do not rely only on those). You may also file a lost report with shelters including PURRS Naperville, since the pet owner may also call there looking for their lost pet.  Wait for 7 days and THEN contact a rescue for placement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You may also take the cat immediately to DuPage County Animal Care &amp; Control or to the Animal Control facility in your town</strong> (such as Naperville Animal Control). However be aware that space is often limited, and after 7 days the cat might be euthanized.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IF YOU HAVE FOUND A BADLY INJURED STRAY:</strong> please call our emergency number at: 630-815-4520.</li>
          <li><strong>IF YOU HAVE FOUND VERY YOUNG BABY KITTENS</strong> (less than 4 weeks old with blue eyes, shaky walk): Please call <a href="http://helpinganimals.org/">H.E.L.P.</a> in St. Charles, or <a href="http://pawsandpurrs.org/">Paws and Purrs Humane Society</a> in Oswego.  We are unable to care for bottle-fed kittens.</li>
