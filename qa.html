          <h2><a name="adopt"></a>How does the adoption process work?</h2>
          <p>
            When you&rsquo;ve found a cat you like, stop by during weekend adoption hours (Saturday and Sunday from 1pm–4pm) at <a href="contact.html">the pet stores</a>, or <a href="contact.html">make an appointment</a> with an adoption counselor. You can also complete an <a href="files/purrs_adoption_application.pdf">adoption application</a> in advance to put a hold on the cat (down payment required.)
          </p>
          <p>Adopters must be at least 21 years old. All members of the household must agree to the adoption.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the store, we'll conduct a brief interview while you socialize with the cat. Once your application is approved—usually same day—you&rsquo;ll complete the <a href="files/purrs_adoption_contract.pdf">adoption contract</a> and pay with cash, check, or credit card.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, you&rsquo;ll be ready to take home your new buddy&mdash;along with complete medical records, pet store coupons, and a free veterinary visit.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h2><a name="declaw"></a>Can I adopt a declawed cat, or declaw one of your cats?</h2>
          <p>
            We don&rsquo;t support declawing cats. When you adopt from PURRS, we&rsquo;ll ask you to agree to never declaw your cat. Declawing can be <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/cats/tips/declawing.html">troubling for the cat</a> and may lead to behavior problems. Instead, we can help you train your cat to use scratching posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is still possible to adopt a declawed cat from PURRS. Some cats come to us having already been declawed by previous owners. When this is the case, it will be listed in the cat's profile.
          </p>

          <h2><a name="surrender"></a>What should I do if I can no longer keep my pet?</h2>
          <p>
            We don&rsquo;t usually accept cats directly from individuals. We mainly bring in our adoptable cats from other organizations.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>If you originally adopted your cat from a shelter, you <em>must</em> contact that shelter first.</strong> They might be able to accept the cat back into their organization, and have the &ldquo;right of first refusal.&rdquo; If the original shelter cannot accept the cat, then...
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>We strongly recommend that you try to find a new home for the cat yourself</strong> since shelters are often full. Try advertising on sites like Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Ask family, friends, neighbors—and ask them to ask their family, friends and neighbors.  Take great pictures of your cat looking her best and post them just about anywhere you can.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If that doesn't work, we recommend contacting <a href="http://www.dupageco.org/animalcontrol/">DuPage County Animal Care & Control</a>.</strong> Due to their amazing dedication, they did not have to euthanize a single animal in 2013! They work very hard with rescue organizations to find homes for their animals.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2><a name="behavior"></a>My cat’s behavior has become a problem, can you suggest some solutions?</h2>
          <p>
            Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly via phone or email, describing your situation. Tell us about the problem and how long it&rsquo;s been happening. Be sure to include info about any other pets and family members in the household.  We&rsquo;re happy to help&mdash;PURRS offers free behavioral advice for the life of your pet!

          <h2><a name="neuter"></a>Where can I find a low cost spay/neuter clinic?</h2>
          <p>
            A great local resource is the <a href="http://fvawl.org/index.php/sn-clinic/services">Fox Valley Animal Welfare League</a> in Aurora. Spaying/neutering is based on income, and prices range from only $30-50 per cat.
          </p>

        <h2><a name="feral"></a>I have feral cats in my neighborhood, what should I do?</h2>
        <p>
          There is a great program that helps to control the feral cat population in DuPage County called Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR). This service is performed by <a href="http://www.feralfixers.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=5">Feral Fixers</a>. We fully support the efforts of Feral Fixers, which is a donation-driven organization that will spay/neuter feral cats at little or no cost.  If you or someone you know has a feral cat problem, please contact Feral Fixers at (630) 881-FXRS (3977).

        <h2><a name="stray"></a>I found a stray cat...now what?</h2>
        <p>
          PURRS and many other rescues do not take in strays off the street. This is because there is a required 7-day waiting period for strays in DuPage County, to give them a chance to be reclaimed by their owner. You have 3 choices with a stray animal:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Take the cat to any vet, shelter, or PURRS adoption event</strong> (weekends at the pet stores from 1-4pm) and have the cat scanned for a microchip to see if an owner can be located.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notify <a href="http://www.dupageco.org/animalcontrol/">DuPage Animal Care &amp; Control</a>, plus the Animal Control office of your city AND surrounding cities and file a “Found Pet Report.”</strong> That is where owners are going to check for their lost cat (of course signs around the neighborhood are good too, but do not rely only on those). You may also file a lost report with shelters including PURRS Naperville, since the owner may also call there looking for their lost pet.  Wait for 7 days and THEN contact a rescue for placement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You may also take the cat immediately to <a href="http://www.dupageco.org/animalcontrol/">DuPage County Animal Care &amp; Control</a>.</strong> However be aware that space is often limited, and it is possible that the cat might be euthanized. (However in 2013, they acheived zero euthinized animals!)
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h2><a name="stats"></a>How many cats have found homes thanks to PURRS Naperville?</h2>
        <p>We are proud to have helped hundreds of cats find loving homes since our founding in 2009! Here are some recent statistics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2012: <strong>480</strong> adoptions</li>
          <li>2013: <strong>339</strong> adoptions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Thanks to all of our generous volunteers and the wonderful adopters that make all of this possible!
